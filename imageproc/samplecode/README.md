# eoh23
The repo for OSAI's EOH'23 exhibit.

This project uses OpenCV, MatPlotLib, NumPy and TensorFlow to create a few computer vision tools - that apply filters to video-frames captured in real-time

## Different prongs of the project
1. Image filters (similar to Instagram/Snapchat filters)
2. ML (object detection, face detection, etc.), transfering this to accessible tools

### Image filters
1. Replace user's eyes with the illini I logo
2. Cartoonify the user's face (trace detection, color quantization, and contour tracing)
3. Replace user's background with a different image
4. Easter bunny ears
5. Drawing with your nose
6. (ML) emotion detection (happy, sad, angry, etc.) and apply a filter based on that
7. Recording the user + filter and saving it to a file

### ML (accessibility tools)
1. Eyeball tracking for moving the cursor
2. Blinking to click
3. Lip tracking to type (or switch filters)
